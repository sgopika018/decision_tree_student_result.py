Implemented a Decision Tree classifier using entropy to predict student pass/fail result based on attendance, study hours, and internal marks.
# Student Result Prediction using Decision Tree

This project uses a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict whether a student
will **Pass or Fail** based on academic factors.

## Features Used
- Attendance (High / Low)
- Study Hours (Yes / No)
- Internal Marks (Good / Poor)

## Algorithm
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Criterion: Entropy (Information Gain)

## Libraries Used
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Output
The model predicts whether a new student will **Pass** or **Fail**
based on the given inputs.
